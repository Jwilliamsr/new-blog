## About me
Welcome, my name is Jesse Williams. 

This is where I house my thoughts on topics that interest me including my founding journey, product marketing, open sources strategies, startup operations, and anything else that appeals to me. The opinions that you will find in my posts are my own, they do not represent the views of my companies, partners, or past employers, and are taken directly from my current views on life, which I expect will change as I grow and experience more. Life is a journey, you can follow mine or ignore it ... trolling is unappreciated.

All is grace,
Jesse

## What's with the random art
I'm sure that after looking around my site, many of you are wondering "What's with the random art?"

It's difficult to find good art these days. Maybe it's because the appreciation for art is dieing or maybe it's because we're constantly bombarded with cheap knock-offs? Either way, I love art and hope that my appreciation for it gets transfered to those who visit my site. I've included links to learn more about the artists under each image. Sorry in advance for all the Picasso, I've felt a connection to his work and hope to own a few original pieces in the future.
